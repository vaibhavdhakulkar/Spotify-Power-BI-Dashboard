# Spotify-Power-BI-Dashboard
Spotify Music Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze how music listening patterns evolve over time. The report highlights trends across albums, artists and tracks, compares Latest Year vs Previous Year, and uncovers behaviour patterns using heat maps and quadrant analysis. A great blend of analytics + data storytelling. 🎧📊

🎧 Power BI Project – Spotify Music Analytics Dashboard

Music consumption today is not just about what people listen to, but how, when, and why they listen.
To understand this deeper, I built a fully interactive Power BI dashboard based on Spotify listening history, transforming raw listening data into meaningful insights about user behaviour, engagement and preferences.

This dashboard explores listening patterns across albums, artists and tracks with a strong focus on time-based insights, behavioural segmentation and growth comparison. Users can seamlessly discover how their music journey evolved over months and years.

Through this project, I analysed:
🔹 Total listening activity over time
🔹 Year-wise shifts in music diversity (minimum & maximum albums, artists, tracks)
🔹 Listening behaviour on Weekdays vs Weekends
🔹 Top 5 most-listened Albums, Artists and Tracks

To measure growth, the dashboard also compares:
📌 Latest Year (LY) vs Previous Year (PY)
📌 YoY (Year-over-Year) trend analysis for albums, artists and tracks

One of the most insightful sections of the dashboard is Listening Hours Analysis, which uses a Heat Map to highlight peak listening times across days and hours of the week. Additionally, the Track Scatter Plot with Quadrant Analysis categorizes tracks based on frequency vs listening duration to identify:
✨ Highly engaging music
✨ Short frequent plays
✨ Long niche favourites
✨ Less-played tracks

This project strengthened my skills in DAX, Data Modeling, Time Intelligence, Trend Analysis, Behavioral Analytics and Data Storytelling using Power BI.
